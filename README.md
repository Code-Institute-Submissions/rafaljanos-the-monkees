# "The Monkees" Web page

Milestone Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is a website for a rock band called "The Monkees".
It introduce all the band`s members, some of them tracks, photos and video clip.
It also gives a user opportunity to download either Android or iOS app for their mobile device to access latest news and information.
They can also find information regarding tours and concerts a swell as contact them throe a form.

## UX

My aim in the design was to easy access and navigate to desired information on the site. 

For users, I was aiming to outline general information about the bands history its members. On the home page I gave users opportunity to download mobile app to have acces to latest news and informatio if they like.
There is a gallery page to give them a glimps of how the band looked when they started and also how they look now. They can find tracks and video clip to check out their music.
And for those who wish to see them live a page with upcomming concerts and gigs which include addresses and dates. And on the last page I`m giving users chance to contact bands management team if they wish to organise a gig.
From every page there is an access to bands Tweeter, Facebook and YouTube account.

The bands logo was custom made by me using Corel Draw:

All photos and backgrounds ware edited using Corel Photo-Paint:

## Features

This site uses Bootstrap Grid system.
Navigation bar is fixed and stays on top of the screen, it uses Bootstrap font-awesome. Navbar also stays 
collapsed in mobile view to free some room for content.

## Features Left to Implement

In the future, I am planning to add more photos and links to external sources for more music, track and video clips. 
I wish also to add google maps for each concert address for easy gps navigation.
Add slide shows to gallery and animated background to home page.

## Testing

The home page achived the intendend outcome by providing the user with short intruduction of the band and also 
quick access to a download site with the original band`s app.
All of the pages give user quick and easy access to band social media accounts like Facebook, Tweeter and 
Youtube channel via Font Awesome inons. User can also get the excact time, date and place of any upcoming 
venues this year. On the mobile view navbar is collapsed and let the user to navigate throe all websites 
quickly and without compromising on content that fits on their screens.

If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the 
invalid email address. There is also the "required" attribute added to all fields, so in case one of them 
is skipped the form will not subit.
Only when all the fields will have a correct content, the form will go through.

All provided links will open in a new tab using "target=_blank" attribute. They all have been manually 
tested to ensure they all go to the correct destination.

All the navbar Font Awesome icons are in the same position across all pages, they all grow on hoower by using "hvr-grow-shadow" class.
Navbar in mobile view will turn in to a hamburger menu at screen resolution smaller than 992px  using a "@media" media queries. 
And will stay the same across all pages, all pages links will also grow on hoover like on big screen but will have no Font Awesome 
icons with them to minimise taken space. All navbars links are in the same order on a big screen and small screen colapsed bar.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, FireFox) and on 
multiple mobile devices (iPhone 4, 5, 7: Chrome and Safari, iPad, Samsung Galaxy) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness.
